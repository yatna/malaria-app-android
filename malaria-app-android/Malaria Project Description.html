<body><h1>Malaria Project Description</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Peace Corps is looking to design a mobile app that will aid the Volunteer in sustaining life-saving malaria prevention tactics over their 2+ years of service. This includes sustained use of preventive meds, wearing of protective clothing and sleeping under a bed net.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The hope is to use the latest thinking in using technology to influence behavior to provide assistance to the 1,000â€™s of Peace Corps Volunteers serving in Malaria endemic regions of the world. We are interested in experimenting with all possible options including gamification, social sharing, and tracking within a mobile application.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Participants will be presented with two recent studies conducted by the CDC pertaining to use of preventative tactics by volunteers and their reasons for compliance or non-compliance. Participants will also be given access to experts at Peace Corps, State Dept. and the CDC to help understand the science of Malaria prevention and the findings of the recent research.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The goal of this particular project is to create multiple prototypes for testing with volunteers. These prototypes will be presented to Volunteers in the field for their feedback during the week of the project and iterations of the prototypes will be created and tested again. Learnings from this rapid prototyping cycle will then be transferred to Peace Corps developers who will develop the most promising prototypes for a larger pilot.&nbsp;</p><p></p></body>
